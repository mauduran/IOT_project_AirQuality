# IOT project AirQuality
According to the World Health Organization, air pollution is the main risk for health because microscopic contaminants can enter the respiratory and circulatory systems, damaging the lungs, heart, and brain.  As said, the importance of monitoring air quality is evident in the impact pollutants have on the human health, so companies are starting to give a track of this issue.
To act on the impact of air pollution on human living, it is necessary to understand where and how the pollution is most concentrated, for doing this air monitoring must be undertaken. 

This IOT project aims to ensure that people are not inhaling bad air and maintain the closed space on the healthier side, possibly reducing risk of illness.

Users can visualize current and historic Air Quality levels so they can act when the quality is not good by filtering the air or opening windows. Additonally, if users register their phone on the web app, they can receive SMS alerts when the levels of any of the pollutants is considered unhealthy.
